    <p>A girl who codes - or, at least, is learning to code. After years of working on ecommerce sites and watching my JIRA tickets constantly get deprioritized, I am taking control of my work. Why am I here? Because 8 months to get a search results page styled with CSS to match the current site theme is ridiculous.</p>
   
    <p>I've always been better at math and science. I hated English classes because there was never a "right" answer - it was all about feelings and what you think some dead author meant. </p>
    
    <p>Coding makes sense to me because I understand formulas, syntax, and relationships.</p>
